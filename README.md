# Minecraft Datapacks
#### A collection of datapacks to enhance vanilla SMP gameplay

## z_sleep
#### A configurable `n`-player sleep datapack for servers

### Features
- Configure how many players must sleep to pass the night by:
  - fixed number of players (e.g. 1) or
  - percent of players (e.g. 50% of overworld players)
- Chat notification (with names) when players sleep
  - 1-click chat link to wake sleeping players before night passes
- Night passes instantly after sleeping for 100 game-ticks, just like single-player
- Correctly resets weather timers (no constant rain storms)

## z_tnt
#### A vanilla-friendly way to break bedrock using "super-charged" TNT

### Features
- Break bedrock and other normally unbreakable blocks when TNT entity explodes inside TNT block
- Configure explosion pattern: star (6 sides) or cube (3x3x3)
- Optionally prevent breaking bottom layer of bedrock (similar to dragon egg glitch, and to avoid easy void trap griefing)
- Optionally require exploding TNT to be encased in unbreakable blocks (to increase difficulty and cost obsidian)
